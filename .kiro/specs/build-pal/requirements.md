# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Build Pal is a development tool that provides a unified command-line interface for triggering build and test actions across different project types (Bazel, Maven, etc.). The tool consists of a CLI client that communicates with a local server to execute build commands and provides a web interface for viewing real-time logs, build summaries, and build history. The system aims to streamline the development workflow by providing consistent build tooling and enhanced visibility into build processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure my project to work with build_pal by specifying the build tool type, so that the system knows how to execute my build commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a `.build_pal` config file in the project root THEN the system SHALL read the tool type configuration
2. WHEN the config file specifies a supported tool type (bazel, maven, etc.) THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate command execution strategy
3. WHEN the config file is malformed or missing required fields THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN the config file specifies an unsupported tool type THEN the system SHALL display an error listing supported tool types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want support for common build systems like Bazel and Maven, so that I can use build_pal across my different types of projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project type is "bazel" THEN the system SHALL execute commands using the bazel binary
2. WHEN the project type is "maven" THEN the system SHALL execute commands using the mvn binary
3. WHEN executing bazel commands THEN the system SHALL preserve bazel-specific syntax like target specifications
4. WHEN executing maven commands THEN the system SHALL support standard maven lifecycle phases and goals
5. WHEN adding new build system support THEN the system SHALL use a pluggable architecture for easy extension

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build_pal server to run as a background service, so that I can execute build commands without manually starting the server each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build_pal CLI is invoked THEN the system SHALL automatically start the server if it's not already running
2. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL accept multiple concurrent build requests from different projects
3. WHEN a build command is executed THEN the system SHALL spawn it as a subprocess with proper process management
4. WHEN the server is idle for an extended period THEN the system SHALL continue running to avoid startup delays
5. WHEN the system shuts down THEN the server SHALL gracefully terminate any running build processes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trigger build commands using a consistent CLI interface regardless of the underlying build system, so that I can maintain a uniform workflow across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `build_pal <command>` in a project directory THEN the system SHALL detect the project type from a `.build_pal` config file
2. WHEN the project type is detected THEN the system SHALL send the command to the local build_pal server with the current working directory, tool type, and command string
3. WHEN the server receives the command THEN the system SHALL return both a command ID and a localhost URL in the format `http://localhost:8081/build_pal/v1/jobs/{slug}` for viewing the build logs
4. IF no `.build_pal` config file exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the project is not configured for build_pal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view real-time build logs in a web interface, so that I can monitor the progress of my build or test execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the provided localhost URL THEN the system SHALL display a webpage with streaming build logs
2. WHEN the build command is executing THEN the system SHALL stream output in real-time to the webpage
3. WHEN the build command completes THEN the system SHALL display the final status (success/failure) and execution time
4. WHEN the user refreshes the page during execution THEN the system SHALL display all previously captured logs plus continue streaming
5. WHEN multiple browser tabs or sessions access the same build URL THEN each SHALL receive the same log content and real-time updates
6. WHEN a user opens a build URL after the command has completed THEN the system SHALL replay the complete log history from the beginning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web interface to provide build context information, so that I understand which project and command generated the logs I'm viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying build logs THEN the system SHALL show the project directory, build tool type, and exact command executed
2. WHEN displaying build logs THEN the system SHALL show the start time and current duration of the execution
3. WHEN displaying build logs THEN the system SHALL provide a clear page title indicating the project and command
4. WHEN multiple builds are running THEN each SHALL have a unique URL and display its own context information
5. WHEN a build URL is bookmarked THEN the system SHALL preserve access to those logs for a reasonable retention period

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a summary view of build results that highlights errors and test failures, so that I can quickly identify and address issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build or test command completes THEN the system SHALL parse the logs for errors, warnings, and test failures
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL display them in a highlighted summary section at the top of the page
3. WHEN test failures are detected THEN the system SHALL extract and display the failing test names and failure messages
4. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success summary with key metrics (build time, test count, etc.)
5. WHEN the log parsing encounters unknown formats THEN the system SHALL still display the raw logs without breaking the interface

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see git branch and commit information for each build, so that I can understand the code context for each build or test execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build is executed THEN the system SHALL capture the current git branch name and commit hash
2. WHEN displaying build history THEN the system SHALL show the branch name and short commit hash for each build entry
3. WHEN viewing detailed build logs THEN the system SHALL display the full commit information including commit message and author
4. WHEN a build is executed THEN the system SHALL capture and store the git diff of any uncommitted changes at build time
5. IF the project is not a git repository THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the absence of git information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view the git diff and commit history for each build, so that I can understand exactly what changes were being tested or built.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a build's detailed page THEN the system SHALL display a git diff showing uncommitted changes at build time
2. WHEN viewing a build's detailed page THEN the system SHALL show recent commit history leading up to the build
3. WHEN displaying git diffs THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and collapsible sections for readability
4. WHEN there are no uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL indicate the build was run on a clean working directory
5. WHEN git information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message without breaking the interface

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build logs and history to persist across server restarts, so that I don't lose valuable build information when the system is restarted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build_pal server starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a local database (such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store build data
2. WHEN a build is executed THEN the system SHALL persist all build information including logs, metadata, and git context to the database
3. WHEN the server is restarted THEN the system SHALL restore all previous build history and make it accessible through the web interface
4. WHEN viewing historical builds THEN the system SHALL retrieve complete log data from persistent storage
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to in-memory storage with appropriate user warnings
6. WHEN storing build logs THEN the system SHALL compress the log data to minimize disk space usage while maintaining fast retrieval
7. WHEN retrieving compressed logs THEN the system SHALL decompress them transparently without impacting the user experience
8. WHEN storing build logs THEN the system SHALL implement deduplication to avoid storing identical log content multiple times
9. WHEN multiple builds produce similar output THEN the system SHALL reference shared log segments to minimize storage duplication

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view the history of my build and test runs for a specific project, so that I can track patterns and revisit previous executions for that project.

#### Acceptance Criteria
