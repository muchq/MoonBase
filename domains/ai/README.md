# AI Domain

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning libraries and services.

## Apps

- [**impact-mcp**](apps/impact_mcp): A local-first AI agent that helps engineers amplify their impact, close gaps against a customizable rubric, and communicate contributions clearly — for better project results and career growth.
- [**microgpt (cli)**](apps/microgpt_cli): CLI agent for local training, inference, and model inspection. Wraps the full microgpt workflow in a single binary.

## APIs

- [**microgpt-serve**](apis/microgpt_serve): HTTP inference service for microgpt. Loads a trained checkpoint and serves generation requests via a JSON API, built on server_pal.

## Libraries

- [**Neuro**](libs/neuro): A pure Go implementation of a deep neural network library suitable for training classification models on images, text, and audio data. Features support for various layer types, optimizers, and inference utilities.
- [**microgpt**](libs/microgpt): A minimal GPT implementation in pure Rust with a from-scratch autograd engine. Ported from [karpathy's microgpt.py](https://gist.github.com/aaylward/f9cfa5bff5aada3dcce46db0110eb34e) — the complete algorithm; everything else is just efficiency.
