# Readiness Assessment

Use the impact-mcp MCP server to get a comprehensive breakdown of your promotion readiness.

## Steps

1. Call the `readiness_check` prompt from the impact-mcp server to get full scoring details
2. Review overall readiness score and how it's calculated
3. Explain each dimension's score and what it means:
   - None (0%): No meaningful evidence
   - Weak (25%): Sparse or low-confidence evidence
   - Moderate (60%): Moderate evidence, gaps remain
   - Strong (100%): Strong, well-supported evidence
4. Show archetype strength distribution
5. Provide concrete next steps to improve readiness score
6. Identify which dimensions would have the biggest impact if improved (considering weights)

## Example Usage

When you invoke this command, I will:
- Fetch your complete readiness data
- Explain your overall score and how it's weighted
- Break down each dimension's coverage level
- Show your archetype strength profile
- Recommend specific actions that would most improve your score
- Help you understand what "good" looks like for each dimension

You'll understand exactly where you stand and how to improve.

## Understanding Readiness

**A high readiness score is necessary but not sufficient for promotion.**

### What Readiness Measures

Readiness measures whether you're demonstrating the right behaviors. But promotion requires:
- **6-12 months of sustained performance** at the next level
- **Consistent evidence** across dimensions over time
- **Pattern recognition** by your manager and peers that you've been operating at that level

### What Readiness Doesn't Measure

**The quality and importance of your projects.** You could have:
- High readiness from executing assigned work well → Not promotable
- High readiness from trivial but technically excellent work → Not promotable
- High readiness from identifying critical problems and driving solutions → Promotable

### Staff+ Level Reality

At Staff+ level, HOW you generate evidence matters:

- ❌ **High score, low-impact work**: "I executed perfectly on all my assigned tickets"
- ❌ **High score, wrong scope**: "I built a technically excellent solution to a minor problem"
- ✅ **High score, high-impact work**: "I identified this critical issue, made the case for why it mattered, and led the effort to solve it"

Think of readiness as a leading indicator that you're demonstrating the right behaviors. But those behaviors must be applied to important problems you proactively identify.

Check your readiness regularly, but don't expect promotion until you've maintained strong readiness for 6+ months while working on clearly important, proactively identified initiatives.
