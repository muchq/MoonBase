# Promotion Packet Generator

Use the impact-mcp MCP server to generate a comprehensive promotion packet narrative.

## Steps

1. Call the `packet_draft` prompt from the impact-mcp server to get all evidence organized by rubric dimensions
2. Review the current readiness score and evidence coverage
3. Generate a structured promotion packet with:
   - Executive summary of readiness
   - Evidence organized by rubric dimension
   - Archetype strengths and how they manifest
   - Identified gaps and how you're addressing them
4. Emphasize concrete outcomes, scope, and growth trajectory
5. Tell a compelling story that connects individual pieces of evidence into a cohesive narrative

## Example Usage

When you invoke this command, I will:
- Fetch all your evidence cards via the MCP server
- Organize them by your active rubric dimensions
- Calculate your readiness score
- Generate a comprehensive promotion packet draft
- Highlight your archetype strengths
- Note any gaps that should be addressed

The packet will be structured, evidence-based, and ready for refinement.

## Staff+ Level Requirements

**Project selection and initiative are critical.** At Staff+ level:

- **Impact matters more than perfection**: Doing excellent work on trivial projects won't get you promoted
- **Identify, don't just execute**: Staff+ engineers surface important problems and drive solutions; it's not enough to do assigned work well
- **Articulate business value**: Every major accomplishment should clearly explain WHY it mattered to the company/customers
- **Demonstrate scope**: Your work should affect teams, systems, or outcomes at significant scale

**Questions your packet must answer:**
- Did you identify these problems or just execute on assignments?
- Why were these projects important to the company?
- How did you drive progress vs. contributing to someone else's initiative?
- What would have happened if you hadn't done this work?

## Timeline Expectations

**Promotion requires 6-12 months of sustained performance at the next level.** Your packet should demonstrate:
- Consistent impact over months, not just recent wins
- Patterns of behavior that show you're already operating at the target level
- Evidence distribution across time periods, not clustered around packet-writing time
- Repeated pattern of identifying important work and driving it

A strong packet tells a story of sustained growth and proactive leadership, not a sudden sprint or excellent execution on assignments.
