# Gap Analysis

Use the impact-mcp MCP server to identify and prioritize gaps in your promotion readiness.

## Steps

1. Call the `gap_analysis` prompt from the impact-mcp server to get identified gaps
2. Review current readiness score and dimension-level coverage
3. Analyze which dimensions have weak or no coverage
4. Provide a prioritized action plan with:
   - Concrete steps to close each gap
   - Effort and timeline estimates
   - Suggested types of evidence to gather
   - Quick wins vs. longer-term investments
5. Recommend specific projects or initiatives that could address multiple gaps

## Example Usage

When you invoke this command, I will:
- Fetch your current readiness assessment
- Identify dimensions with weak or no evidence
- Prioritize gaps by rubric dimension weight
- Suggest specific, actionable steps to close each gap
- Recommend projects that provide high leverage

You'll get a clear action plan for improving your promotion readiness.

## Staff+ Gap-Closing Strategy

**Closing gaps isn't about doing more work — it's about doing more important work.**

### Project Selection for Gap-Closing

When choosing projects to address gaps:

1. **High-impact opportunities**: Look for problems that matter to the company, not just technically interesting challenges
2. **Proactive identification**: Can you surface this problem yourself, or are you waiting to be assigned?
3. **Scope alignment**: Does this work demonstrate Staff+ level scope and complexity?
4. **Clear business value**: Can you articulate why this matters to customers/company?

**Wrong approach**: "I'll close my Architecture gap by doing more design reviews"
**Right approach**: "I'll close my Architecture gap by identifying a critical scalability issue and leading the redesign"

### Timeline Considerations

**You need 6-12 months of sustained performance at the next level.** Gap analysis should factor in:
- **Urgency vs. Time:** Some gaps take months to address through repeated demonstrations
- **Initiative finding:** Build a habit of proactively surfacing important problems in gap areas
- **Impact articulation:** Practice explaining business value in all communications
- **Consistency:** One big win doesn't close a gap — you need repeated evidence over time

Start addressing gaps early with high-impact, proactively identified work.
