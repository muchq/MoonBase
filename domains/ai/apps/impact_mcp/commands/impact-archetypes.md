# Archetype Coaching

Use the impact-mcp MCP server to understand your staff archetype profile and get strategic advice.

## Staff Archetypes

The seven staff engineer archetypes are:

1. **Tech Lead** — Leading teams through technical direction and mentorship
2. **Architect** — Designing and evolving systems at scale
3. **Problem Solver** — Tackling critical, ambiguous challenges
4. **Operator** — Ensuring reliability, efficiency, and operational excellence
5. **Mentor** — Growing engineers and building organizational capability
6. **Right Hand** — Extending executive attention across complex organizations
7. **Glue** — Doing the essential cross-team work that holds organizations together

## Steps

1. Call the `archetype_review` prompt from the impact-mcp server to get your current archetype profile
2. Review which archetypes are represented in your evidence
3. Identify your dominant archetype(s) based on evidence distribution
4. Provide coaching on:
   - Which archetypes to lean into based on your strengths and role expectations
   - How to develop underrepresented archetypes if they're valuable for your goals
   - How to showcase archetype strengths in status updates and narratives
   - How your archetype mix aligns with promotion expectations
5. Suggest specific ways to frame your work through an archetype lens

## Example Usage

When you invoke this command, I will:
- Fetch your archetype strength distribution from evidence
- Identify your dominant archetype(s)
- Explain what each archetype means and how it manifests
- Coach you on which archetypes to emphasize
- Help you frame your impact through the right archetype lens
- Suggest ways to develop archetypes that matter for your promotion

You'll get strategic guidance on shaping your staff engineer identity.

## Building Archetype Identity Over Time

Staff engineer archetypes aren't just labels — they're patterns of behavior that others recognize in you over time. To be seen as a strong Tech Lead or Architect:

- **Demonstrate consistently:** One instance doesn't define you; repeated patterns do
- **6-12 month horizon:** People need months of observation to associate you with an archetype
- **Narrative alignment:** Your status updates, design docs, and conversations should reinforce your archetype story

Choose your archetype emphasis deliberately, then demonstrate it consistently for at least 6 months before expecting it to be part of your promotion narrative.
