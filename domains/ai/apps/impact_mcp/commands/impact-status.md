# Weekly Status Update

Use the impact-mcp MCP server to draft a status update from recent evidence.

## Steps

1. Call the `weekly_status` prompt from the impact-mcp server to get recent evidence and context
2. Review the evidence and readiness score provided
3. Draft a concise status update highlighting key accomplishments from the past week
4. Focus on impact and outcomes, not just tasks completed
5. Consider framing the update around your dominant staff archetype if suggested

## Example Usage

When you invoke this command, I will:
- Fetch your recent evidence cards via the MCP server
- Review your current readiness score
- Generate a draft status update that emphasizes impact
- Suggest narrative framing based on your archetype profile

The draft will be ready for you to review, edit, and send.

## Context

Regular status updates build a track record of sustained impact. Promotion requires performing at the next level for 6-12 months consistently — weekly updates document that journey.

### Staff+ Level Communication

At Staff+ level, **how you communicate impact matters**:

- **Articulate business importance**: Don't just say "fixed the API" — explain why it mattered to customers/company
- **Highlight initiative**: Distinguish work you identified and drove vs. assigned tasks you completed
- **Emphasize scope**: Staff+ work involves important problems, not just any problems done well
- **Show proactivity**: The best evidence shows you surfaced issues and drove solutions, not just responded to tickets

Remember: Executing well on trivial work, even consistently, won't get you promoted. Staff+ engineers identify what's important and make it happen.
