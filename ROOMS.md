# Room-Based Multi-Game Architecture

The golf game system now implements a room-based architecture that separates the concepts of rooms and games to enable flexible multi-game scenarios. **Rooms** serve as persistent containers that maintain player membership, cumulative statistics, and game history, while **Games** are individual match instances with their own unique IDs and game state. • Players join rooms using `joinGame` messages with `roomId` field, establishing their membership in a social space where they can participate in multiple sequential or concurrent games. • Each room can host multiple games simultaneously, allowing different groups of players within the same room to play separate matches (e.g., a 4-player room could have two concurrent 2-player games running). • Room-level statistics track cumulative scores, total games played, and win counts across all games, while individual games maintain their own scoring and state management. • The `JoinGameMessage` structure supports both `roomId` (required) and `gameId` (optional) fields, where omitting `gameId` joins the room's current/default game, but specifying both allows joining specific games within the room for future concurrent game support. • This design enables "play again" functionality by creating new games within existing rooms, maintains social connections between players across multiple matches, and provides a foundation for advanced features like tournaments, spectator modes, and room-specific game variants.
